# 🎵 How to Add Your Music - SUPER SIMPLE!

## 🚀 Quick Steps:

### 1. Add Your Music Files
Put your music files in this folder (`/public/music/`):
```
public/music/
├── my-song.mp3
├── another-track.mp3
└── cool-music.mp3
```

### 2. Update the Playlist
Open `src/data/music.ts` and add your files:

```typescript
export const playlist: Track[] = [
  { filename: "my-song.mp3", title: "My Awesome Song" },
  { filename: "another-track.mp3", title: "Another Great Track" },
  { filename: "cool-music.mp3", title: "Cool Music" },
];
```

### 3. Test It!
- Refresh your website

- Your music should start playing!

## 📝 Example:

If you have a file called `Silverstein - Smile In Your Sleep.mp3`, add it like this:

```typescript
export const playlist: Track[] = [
  { 
    filename: "Silverstein - Smile In Your Sleep.mp3", 
    title: "Silverstein - Smile In Your Sleep" 
  },
];
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

**Music not playing?**

**Button not working?**
1. Make sure you clicked it (user interaction required)
2. Check that playlist is not empty in `music.ts`

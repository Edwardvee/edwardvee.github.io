## 📝 To Add Your Music

1. Download/create your audio files
2. Name them descriptively (e.g., `synthwave-dreams.mp3`)
3. Place them in this `/public/music/` folder
4. Update the playlist in `/src/data/music.ts`
5. Test that they load and play correctly

## 🎛️ Current Playlist Configuration

The music player is configured to play these tracks (update in `music.ts`):
